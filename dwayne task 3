Research and Experimentation

Different machine learning techniques were researched and tested for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset:

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): Simple baseline, achieved good accuracy but was slow for large datasets.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Higher accuracy than kNN but slower in training.

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A simple neural network, achieved high accuracy with faster performance.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Specialized for image data, gave the best overall accuracy and efficiency.

Evaluation Results

kNN: ~96% accuracy

SVM: ~97% accuracy

MLP: ~98% accuracy

CNN: ~99% accuracy

Selected Method

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was chosen as the best method due to its high accuracy and suitability for image recognition tasks.
